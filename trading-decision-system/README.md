# Trading Decision System

## Problem
Retail traders often lose money by trading during choppy or low-quality market conditions.
This project focuses on building a rule based system to decide when to trade and when to stand down.

## Approach
- Identify market regime (trend vs range)
- Use indicators such as RSI and MACD to assess momentum
- Apply rule based logic for trade vs no-trade decisions

## Outcome
The goal is discipline and risk management rather than frequent trades.

## Next Steps
- Implement rules in Python
- Test logic on historical BTC data
- Evaluate performance across market conditions
